# Node.js

## Why node.js?

Before, when we need to build servers, create files, or communicate with databases, we need languages like Ruby, or PHP. With node.js, all of these can be done with the single programming language: Javascript.

1) It uses the single language Javascript
2) It is very fast (runs on the V8 engine and uses non-blocking codes)
3) There is a huge ecosystem of open source packages (npm)
4) Great for real-time services (with the use of websockets)

## V8 engine

Node.js is written in C++. V8 engine is the heart of Node.js. It translate javascript into machine code. The other part of Node.js provides additional functions to the V8 engine.
