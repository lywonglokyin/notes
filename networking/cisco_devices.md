The main feature of these port is that they can connect to devices even if their OS is not yet available. Good for troubleshooting, check BIOS settings remotely, etc.

Used for short-distance connection with cable (RJ45->Serial). However, most computer do not have serial nowaday, so there is an extra cable (Serial->USB). The user has to install a usb to serial driver on computer for usage, with a COM driver install in the pc.

Newer CISCO devices might have a USB port already available so no converting cable is needed.
