# Planning

Include tips during planning stage of development.

## Tracer bullets (TPP P.51)

### What

Write a "Minimum Viable Product" that focuses greatly on the framework of the project, namely the interactions between components, data flows, etc. Afterwards, new features will be added on top of these tracer codes, without modifying the framework.

## Prototypes (TPP P.56)

### What

Focuses on usually a single aspect of the project (e.g. efficiency, UI design), while largely ignorely others. The difference between this and tracer bullets would be that tracer bullets will create a product that is at least presentable to customers or investors. Prototypes are often quick to produce, and is usually disposed after creation. Lessons learnt from prototypes is more important than the code written for prototypes.

### Why

- To eliminate risks of the project, including architecture, new functionalities, third party tools, performances, UI designs

### How

- Many aspects is ignores:

    - Using dummy data
    - Error could be ignored
    - Coding styles could be ignored

- Post-it notes... Great for generating or visualizing ideas.
